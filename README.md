QR CODE GENERATOR
A QR (quick response) code is a two-dimensional barcode readable by a QR code scanners, smart mobile phones with a camera. QR Code can be used to link to any URL. They can also be used to automatically add information into a userâ€™s smartphone such as calendar event, map or personnel contact information. A QR Code is capable of storing several hundred times more information than a conventional barcode and is readable from any direction.
The Project Comprises of two Parts:

1) Build the QR Code Generator application using: ReactJs :- Our app contains two sections. In one section we will take the user inputs such as the text to encode, size of QR code etc and store all of that inside state variables. After that, we will build the required API string to fetch the QR code image. In the other section, we will display the required QR code

2) Host the Application on AWS EC2 Instance:
  a) Setup AWS EC2 Instance
  b) Clone the React application repository or deploy the QR Code Generator application with AWS Amplify
  c) Install the project dependencies
  d) Install & configure (Nginx) Webserver
  e) Configure the QR Code Generator application to work with Nginx (build the application to work on the production) 
  f) Access the React application
